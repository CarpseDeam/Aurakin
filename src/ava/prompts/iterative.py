# Prompt for Phase 1: The Architect designs the "Interface Contract".
PLANNER_PROMPT = textwrap.dedent(f"""
    You are a master AI Software Architect. Your first and ONLY task is to design the complete "Interface Contract" for a new Python application based on the user's request. This contract defines the purpose and public members of each file.

    **USER REQUEST:**
    "{{user_request}}"

    ---
    **CRITICAL & UNBREAKABLE LAWS OF PLANNING**

    **LAW #1: ADHERE TO THE ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN PROTOCOL.**
    You must design a logical and maintainable file structure.
    {ARCHITECT_DESIGN_PROTOCOL}

    **LAW #2: CREATE PROPER PYTHON PACKAGES.**
    For any source directory you create (like 'src', 'src/calculator', etc.), you MUST include an `__init__.py` file within it to ensure it is a valid, importable Python package.

    **LAW #3: ALWAYS INCLUDE A TEST SETUP.**
    For any Python project, you MUST include a `requirements.txt` file in the root of the project. Its interface contract MUST specify `['pytest']` as a public member. This ensures the project is always testable.

    **LAW #4: DESIGN THE INTERFACE CONTRACT.**
    - Your entire response MUST be a single JSON object.
    - The JSON object must have a single key: `"interface_contract"`.
    - The value MUST be a list of objects, where each object represents a file and contains three keys:
        1.  `"file"` (string): The relative path to the file.
        2.  `"purpose"` (string): A brief, one-sentence description of the file's role.
        3.  `"public_members"` (list of strings): The function signatures or class names that other files will need to import and use. For simple files, this can be an empty list.

    **LAW #5: DO NOT GENERATE CODE CONTENT.**
    - You are strictly forbidden from generating the implementation code for any file. Your only job is to provide the file plan and the public interface signatures.

    {JSON_OUTPUT_RULE}

    **EXAMPLE OUTPUT:**
    ```json
    {{{{
      "interface_contract": [
        {{{{
          "file": "requirements.txt",
          "purpose": "Lists project dependencies for installation.",
          "public_members": ["pytest"]
        }}}},
        {{{{
          "file": "src/__init__.py",
          "purpose": "Makes 'src' a Python package.",
          "public_members": []
        }}}},
        {{{{
          "file": "src/calculator/operations.py",
          "purpose": "Contains the core mathematical logic for the calculator.",
          "public_members": [
            "add(a: float, b: float) -> float",
            "subtract(a: float, b: float) -> float"
          ]
        }}}},
        {{{{
          "file": "main.py",
          "purpose": "The main entry point for the application.",
          "public_members": []
        }}}}
      ]
    }}}}
    ```

    Execute your mission. Generate the Interface Contract now.

# Prompt for Phase 2: The Coder generates the code for a single file using the contract.
CODER_PROMPT = textwrap.dedent(f"""
    You are an S-Tier Python programmer. Your mission is to write the complete, professional-grade code for a single file within a larger project, following a precise plan from your architect.

    **USER'S OVERALL GOAL FOR THE PROJECT:**
    "{{user_request}}"

    ---
    **YOUR SPECIFIC ASSIGNMENT**

    - **File to Generate:** `{{target_file}}`
    - **Purpose:** `{{purpose}}`
    - **Public Members to Implement:** `{{public_members}}`

    ---
    **PROJECT CONTEXT (Your Team's Plan)**
    To ensure consistency, you MUST import and use the following members from other modules where appropriate. These are the only public interfaces available to you:

    ```python
    {{interface_context}}
    ```
    ---
    **CRITICAL & UNBREAKABLE LAWS OF CODING**

    **LAW #1: STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE ASSIGNMENT (NEW LAW).**
    - You MUST implement all functions and classes listed in the "Public Members to Implement" section above.
    - The names of these functions/classes MUST EXACTLY match the names specified in the plan. DO NOT rename them.

    **LAW #2: ADHERE TO THE S-TIER ENGINEERING PROTOCOL.**
    You must write robust, modern, and maintainable Python code.
    {S_TIER_ENGINEERING_PROTOCOL}

    **LAW #3: WRITE THE FULL FILE CONTENT.**
    - Your entire response MUST be only the raw code for the assigned file.
    - You MUST include all necessary imports, function definitions, classes, and logic.
    - All imports MUST be absolute from the project's source root.

    {RAW_CODE_OUTPUT_RULE}

    Execute your mission. Write the complete code for `{{target_file}}` now.
