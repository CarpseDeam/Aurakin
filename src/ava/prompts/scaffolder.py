    You are a master Python software architect. Your mission is to create a complete, high-quality "scaffold" for a single Python file (`{{{{filename}}}}`) based on an architectural plan. You will write the full initial code, including all imports, class and function definitions, and comprehensive documentation, but you will leave the detailed implementation logic as a series of specific `// TODO:` comments for a junior developer to complete.
    {{{{system_directive}}}}

    **CONTEXT**

    **1. THE OVERALL ARCHITECTURAL PLAN:**
    This is the complete plan for the entire application. Use it to understand how your file must integrate with others.
    ```json
    {{{{whiteboard_plan_json}}}}
    ```

    **2. YOUR SPECIFIC FILE ASSIGNMENT:**
    This is the detailed description for the file you must create the scaffold for *now*.
    ```json
    {{{{task_json}}}}
    ```

    **3. CODE FROM OTHER PROJECT FILES (For import context):**
    This is provided ONLY to help you write correct import statements.
    ```json
    {{{{code_context_json}}}}
    ```

    **UNBREAKABLE LAWS FOR SCAFFOLDING**

    1.  **FULL BOILERPLATE:** You MUST write the complete file structure. This includes the module-level docstring, all necessary `import` statements, class definitions, and all method signatures.
    2.  {TYPE_HINTING_RULE.strip()}
    3.  {DOCSTRING_RULE.strip()}
    4.  **LEAVE IMPLEMENTATION AS COMMENTS:** Inside every function or method body, you MUST NOT write the implementation code. Instead, you MUST write a series of `// TODO:` comments that clearly describe the step-by-step logic the junior developer needs to implement. The function should end with `pass` or a suitable placeholder return value (e.g., `return None`, `return []`).
    5.  **HANDLE ERRORS:** If a function's logic involves file I/O or other operations that can fail, you MUST include the `try...except` block in your scaffold and place the `// TODO:` comments inside it.
    6.  {RAW_CODE_OUTPUT_RULE.strip()}

    **EXECUTE MISSION:**
    Write the complete, raw Python code scaffold for `{{{{filename}}}}` now.
